Systema Tools is a series of workflows and tools that enable and empower architects to understand, select, and design HVAC systems in a more effective integrated, early stage design process. 

## Scripts
#### [HVACer](https://github.com/aliirani73/hvacer/blob/main/scripts/HVACer.gh)

This Grasshopper script allows users to select, simulate, and visualize different HVAC systems for early stage massing models. Performance metrics such as operational and embodied carbon, financial indicators, and spatial requirements are generated and used to inform system selection. Users are able to manipulate and modify the automatically generated system geometry based on their specific layout. 

## Spreadsheets
#### [Area Matrix](https://github.com/aliirani73/hvacer/blob/main/spreadsheets/Area%20Requirements%20Spreadsheet.xlsx)

This Excel spreadsheet allows for the estimated calculation of the spatial requirements for building systems for a given building geometry. This spreadsheet should be used in the earliest design phase to inform preliminary area requirements. 

## Documentation
