buildVAC is a series of workflows and tools that enable architects to compare a variety of commercial HVAC systems and implement them into their projects  during early stage design.

## 1. Surveys
#### [Industry and Practitioner Survey - Architects](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cPdhVOWmfO97Ymq)
#### [Industry and Practitioner Survey - Sustainability Analysts](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCpPYEcVY7yyrpc)

## 2. Spreadsheets
#### [Design and Calculation Spreadsheets](https://github.com/MITSustainableDesignLab/buildvac/blob/main/spreadsheet/)

The Area Requirements Spreadsheet estimates the spatial requirements for building systems for a given building geometry.  There is a version for commercial and one for residential buildings. 

The Ventilation Requirements Spreadsheet helps to calculate supply air shaft sizes for all-air and minimum outside air systems. 

## 3. Scripts

This Grasshopper script allows users to select, simulate, and visualize different HVAC systems for early stage massing models for commercial office buildings. Performance metrics such as operational and embodied carbon, financial indicators, and spatial requirements are generated and used to inform system selection. Users are able to manipulate and modify the automatically generated system geometry based on their specific layout. 

A sample file, for a typical 3 story medium office, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MITSustainableDesignLab/buildvac/blob/main/Medium%20Office.zip) to be used with the script.
